# Map-of-J-rva-with-pins-and-info-PROG2-project
The big project of the course PROG2 in JavaFX.
The task was to write a program that allows the user to open a map (a background image) and with mouse clicks define places on the map. The places have names, can have a descriptive text and can belong to one of the three categories Bus, Underground or Train1 , but they can also be categorical. The task is inspired by the user interface on kartor.eniro.se, but is of course very simplified and implemented completely differently: the map is just an image, there is none zooming, you can not move on maps (it is not larger than what is shown) etc.
